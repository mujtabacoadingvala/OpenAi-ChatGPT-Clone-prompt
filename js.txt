give me code "This JavaScript code is for a browser-based chat application called Mujtaba-Pro. It connects to the OpenRouter API using GPT-3.5-turbo. The app allows users to send and receive chat messages, stores chat history in localStorage, supports multiple conversations with dynamic titles, and includes UI controls like new chat, clear history, and sidebar toggling. It displays typing indicators during API calls and handles user input via a button or Enter key. The code uses event listeners and DOM manipulation to update the interface based on user interaction."
