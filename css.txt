âœ… Detailed Prompt to Generate This CSS:
Prompt:

Write a full modern, clean, and responsive CSS stylesheet for an AI chat assistant web app. The design should include:

A sidebar with gradient header, buttons for "New Chat" and "Clear History", and styled chat history items with hover and active states.

A chat area with a gradient header, assistant title, message area, welcome message, input field, and send button.

Use :root variables for theme colors including primary, secondary, message background colors, gradients, and shadows.

Style both user and bot messages with different background colors and animations on appearance.

Add a typing indicator with animated dots.

Include media queries for mobile responsiveness (e.g., collapsing the sidebar and resizing input/buttons).

Use a subtle SVG background pattern in the chat message area.

Ensure smooth transitions, hover states, shadows, and spacing for a polished UI feel.

The CSS should be compatible with the corresponding HTML structure and use class-based styling (no IDs for styling). Use modern CSS features and include animations for message appearance and welcome message fade-in.
